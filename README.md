# Web-Application-London-Tours
London Tours is a website built based on a coursework scenario, from my University.
It teaches basic security concenptson how to protect against cross/site scripting and sql injection attacks. 
I enjoyed working on it, so I tried to make to more appealing and add some extra functionality, user with email verifications, admin privileges with a admin panel etc..
